        <h2>The [form] Element</h2>
        <p>
            All forms start with a [form] element, like this:
        </p>
        <pre>[form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post"]
    [label for="name"]Name:[/label]
    [input type="text" id="name" name="user_name"]
[/form]</pre>
        <p>
            This element formally defines a form. It's a container element like a [section] or [footer] element, but
            specifically for containing forms; it also supports some specific attributes to configure the way the form
            behaves. Each time you want to create an HTML form, you must start it by using this element, nesting all the
            contents inside. Many assistive technologies and browser plugins can discover [form] elements and implement
            special hooks to make them easier to use. All of its attributes are optional, but it's standard practice to
            always set at least the action and method attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it
                is submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For usability and accessibility, we include an explicit label for each form control. Note the use of the for
            attribute on all [label] elements, which takes as its value the id of the form control with which it is
            associated — this is how you associate a form control with its label.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is great benefit to doing this — it associates the label with the form control, enabling mouse,
            trackpad, and touch device users to click on the label to activate the corresponding control, and it also
            provides an accessible name for screen readers to read out to their users. You'll find further details of
            form labels in How to structure a web form.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            The [input] tag is an empty element, meaning that it doesn't need a closing tag. [textarea] is not an empty
            element, meaning it should be closed with the proper ending tag. This has an impact on a specific feature of
            forms: the way you define the default value.
        </p>
        <pre>[input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text"]</pre>
        <pre>[textarea]
    by default this element is filled with this text
[/textarea]</pre>
        <p>
            We provide a name to each form control. The names are important on both the client- and server-side; they
            tell the browser which name to give each piece of data and, on the server side, they let the server handle
            each piece of data by name. The form data is sent to the server as name/value pairs.
        </p>
        <pre>[form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post"]
    [ul]
        [li]
            [label for="name"]Name:[/label]
            [input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" /]
        [/li]
        ...
    [/ul]
[/form]</pre>
        <p class="warning">
            Warning: It's strictly forbidden to nest a form inside another form. Nesting can cause forms to behave in an
            unpredictable manner, so it is a bad idea.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's always possible to use a form control outside of a [form] element. If you do so, by default that
            control has nothing to do with any form unless you associate it with a form using the form attribute. This
            was introduced to let you explicitly bind a control with a form even if it is not nested inside it.
        </p>
        <h2>The [fieldset] and [legend] Elements</h2>
        <p>
            The [fieldset] element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for
            styling and semantic purposes. You can label a [fieldset] by including a [legend] element just below the
            opening [fieldset] tag. The text content of the [legend] formally describes the purpose of the [fieldset] it
            is included inside.
        </p>
        <pre>[form]
    [fieldset]
        [legend]Fruit juice size[/legend]
        [p]
            [input type="radio" name="size" id="size_1" value="small"]
            [label for="size_1"]Small[/label]
        [/p]
        [p]
            [input type="radio" name="size" id="size_2" value="medium"]
            [label for="size_2"]Medium[/label]
        [/p]
        [p]
            [input type="radio" name="size" id="size_3" value="large"]
            [label for="size_3"]Large[/label]
        [/p]
    [/fieldset]
[/form]</pre>
        <p>
            When reading the above form, a screen reader will speak "Fruit juice size small" for the first widget,
            "Fruit juice size medium" for the second, and "Fruit juice size large" for the third.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use case in this example is one of the most important. Each time you have a set of radio buttons, you
            should nest them inside a [fieldset] element. There are other use cases, and in general the [fieldset]
            element can also be used to section a form.
