        <span>Main contains an [article], and maybe an [aside]. Let's declare the aside first:</span>
        <aside>
            <ol>
                <li>You might be interested in...</li>

            <p>
                you can (and really should) set the language of your page. This can be done by adding the lang attribute
                to
                the
                opening HTML tag, like [html lang="eng-US"]. You can also set subsections of your document to be
                recognised
                as
                different languages. For example, we could set our Japanese language section to be recognised as
                Japanese,
                with
                <b>[span lang="ja"]ご飯が熱い。[/span]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Japanese: <span lang="ja">ご飯が熱い。</span>It could be rendered because of [meta charset="utf-8"].
                Try with [meta charset='iso-8859-1'] to see it break.
            </p>
            <div>
                Many [meta] elements include name and content attributes. Like
                <ul>
                    <li><b>[meta name="author" content="Shadman Soumik"]</b></li>
                    <li><b>[meta name="description" content="Description of the page"]</b></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                To add a favicon, save the icon in the same directory as the site's index page, saved in .ico format
                (most
                browsers will support favicons in more common formats like .gif or .png, but using the ICO format will
                ensure it
                works as far back as Internet Explorer 6.) This line in [head] adds the favicon:
                <b>[link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"]</b>
            </p>
            <h2 id="document-structure">Document and Website Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar
                standard
                components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art
                project,
                or is
                just badly structured. HTML boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website
                (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column").
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Header ([header]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually
                    stays
                    the
                    same from one webpage to another.
                </dd>
                <dt>Navigation bar ([nav]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the
                    header,
                    this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation
                    on
                    your
                    website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar
                    to
                    be
                    part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some
                    also
                    argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two
                    features
                    better if they are separate.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Main content ([main] with various content subsections represented by [article], [section], and [div]
                    elements.):
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example,
                    the
                    video
                    you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news
                    headlines,
                    etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
                </dd>
                <dt>Sidebar ([aside], often placed inside [main]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in
                    the
                    main
                    content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to
                    related
                    articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary
                    navigation
                    system.
                </dd>
                <dt>Footer ([footer]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or
                    contact
                    info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not
                    critical
                    or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing
                    links
                    for quick access to popular content.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                A typical website structure can be something like: <img src="images/sample-website.png"
                    id="website-structure">
            </p>
            <span>
                Important things to know about website structure:
            </span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    [main] is for content <em>unique to this page</em>. Use [main] only once per page, and put it
                    directly inside [body]. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [article] encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the
                    page (e.g., a single blog post).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [section] is similar to [article], but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page
                    that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines
                    and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that
                    you can break [article]s up into different [section]s, or [section]s up into different [article]s,
                    depending on the context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [aside] contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional
                    information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [header] represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of [body] it defines the
                    global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an [article] or [section] it defines a specific
                    header for that section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [nav] contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go
                    in the navigation.
                </li>
                <li>[footer] represents a group of end content for a page.</li>
                <li>
                    Non-semantic wrappers:
                    Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal semantic element to group
                    some items together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want to just group a set of
                    elements together to affect them all as a single entity with some CSS or JavaScript. For cases
                    like these, HTML provides the [div] and [span] elements. You should use these preferably with a
                    suitable class attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            [div] is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of
                            a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            [span] is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a
                            better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific
                            meaning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="texts-in-html">Texts in HTML</h2>
            <p>
                In HTML we use the [em] (emphasis) element to mark up certain things to stress something. As well as
                making
                the
                document more interesting to read, these are recognised by screen readers and spoken out in a different
                tone
                of
                voice.
                <em>Browsers style this as italic by default (this is inside [em])</em>, but you shouldn't use this tag
                purely
                to get italic styling. To do
                that, you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <i>perhaps an [i] element</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the [strong] (strong importance) element is used to emphasize on something. As well as making
                the
                document
                more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers and spoken in a different tone of voice.
                <strong>Browsers style this as bold text by default (this is inside [strong])</strong>, but you
                shouldn't
                use
                this tag purely
                to get bold styling. To do that,
                you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <b>perhaps a [b] element</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced text formatting</h3>
            <span>Description lists are created using [dl], [dt] (description term) and [dd] (description
                definition)</span>
            <dl>
                <dt>Messi</dt>
                <dd>The greatest footballer the world will ever see.</dd>
                <dt>Ronaldo</dt>

                <dd>Second description</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted
                from
                somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a
                &lt;blockquote&gt; element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside
                a
                cite
                attribute. Browser default styling will render this as an indented paragraph, as an indicator that it is
                a
                quote.
            </p>
            <span>A blockquote, cited by MDN:</span>
            <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
                <p>
                    The HTML <b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element)
                    indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. It was written as
                    <code>[blockquote cite="url"]A paragraph[/blockquote]</code>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the [q] element. This great quote
                <q cite="https://reactnoobie.github.io/hello-world">It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you
                    do

            </p>
            <p>
                The content of the cite attribute sounds useful, but unfortunately browsers, screenreaders, etc. don't
                really do
                much with it. There is no way to get the browser to display the contents of cite, without writing your
                own
                solution using JavaScript or CSS. There is a [cite] element, but this is meant to contain the title of
                the
                resource being quoted, e.g. the name of the book. We can link the text inside [cite] to the quote source
                by
                combining [blockquote] / [q], [cite] and [a]. Citations are styled in italic font by default.

                You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical
                formulae,
                and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The [sup] and [sub] elements handle this.

                There are many elements available for marking up computer code using HTML: [code], [pre], [var], [kbd],
                [samp].
            </p>
            <p>
                [code]: For marking up generic pieces of computer code (inline element). Let's write a multiline sort:
                <code>
                const sort = (a, b) => {
                    console.log(a, b);
                    return a.val - b.val;
                }
            </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                [pre]: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) — if you use indentation or excess whitespace
                inside
                your text,
                browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page. If you wrap the text in
                [pre] tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it in your text editor.
                Let's
                write our multiline sort code inside [pre] tags:
            </p>
            <pre>const sort = (a, b) => {
            console.log(a, b);
            return a.val - b.val;
        }</pre>
            <p>
                [var] tag marks up variable names. In the above examples,
                <var>sort</var> in <code>const <var>sort</var> = ...</code> could be marked up with [var].
            </p>
            <p>
                Use [kbd] tag for marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer. E.g. Press
                <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to reformat code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use [samp] tag for marking up the output of a computer program. Samp is inline:
                <samp>
                    On branch html-modules
                    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/html-modules'.

                    Changes not staged for commit:
                    (use "git add [file]..." to update what will be committed)
                    (use "git restore [file]..." to discard changes in working directory)
                    modified: html-modules.html
                    modified: styles/html-modules.css

                    Untracked files:
                    (use "git add [file]..." to include in what will be committed)
                    exercises/

                    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
                </samp>
            </p>
            <span>Example with [samp], [kbd] inside [pre]:</span>
            <pre>$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
            <samp>On branch html-modules
                Your branch is up to date with 'origin/html-modules'.
                
                Changes not staged for commit:
                (use "git add [file]..." to update what will be committed)
                (use "git restore [file]..." to discard changes in working directory)
                modified:   html-modules.html
                modified:   styles/html-modules.css
                
                Untracked files:
                (use "git add [file]..." to include in what will be committed)
                exercises/
                
                no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</samp></pre>
            <p>
                HTML also provides the [time] element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format. For
                example:
                <code>[time datetime="2016-01-20"]20 January 2016[/time]</code>.
                Why is this useful? Well, there are many different ways that humans write down dates. The above date
                could
                be written as 20th January 2016, Jan 20 2016, 20/01/16, 01/20/16, The 20th of next month, 20e Janvier
                2016,
                2016年1月20日 and so on...
            </p>
            <p>
                But these different forms cannot be easily recognised by computers — what if you wanted to automatically
                grab
                the dates of all events in a page and insert them into a calendar? The [time] element allows you to
                attach
                an
                unambiguous, machine-readable time/date for this purpose. The basic example above just provides a simple
                machine
                readable date, but there are many other options that are possible, for example -
            </p>

            <h2 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h2>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. Well, they've been a feature
                of
                the
                Web since the very beginning, but they are what makes the Web a <em>Web</em> — they allow us to link our
                documents to any
                other document (or other resource) we want to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, and we
                can
                make
                apps available at a simple web address. Just about any web content can be converted to a link, so that
                when
                clicked (or otherwise activated) it will make the web browser go to another web address.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, this link opens in a ne&AElig;w (!) tab (using <b>target="_blank"</b> ).
                Also, on hover, a description is shown (using <b>title="description"</b>):
                <a href="https://reactnoobie.github.io/hello-world" title="FIFA-20 World Cup" target="_blank">
                    Round-robin-2-legged fixture (and standings) generator
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document (known as a document fragment), rather
                than
                just
                to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want
                to
                link
                to. After adding <b>id="image"</b> to our image and <em>href-ing</em> to <b>#image</b>, we have
                <a href="#image">a link that takes us to the image</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can send mail through links using <b>[a href="mailto:"]</b>.
                <a href="mailto:reactnoobie@gmail.com">Mail to me</a>,
                <a href="mailto:">Mail to nobody</a>
                <a
                    href="mailto:reactnoobie@gmail.com?cc=cc@gmail.com&bcc=bcc@gmail.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
                    Mail with cc, bcc, subject, body
                </a>
            </p>
            <span>Some sample <b>mailto:</b> URLs:</span>

            <h3>Link best practices:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use clear wordings. Good: <a href="https://firefox.com/">Download Firefox</a>,
                    Bad: Click <a href="https://firefox.com/">here</a> to download Firefox.
                </li>
                <li>Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text</li>
                <li>Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise.</li>
                <li>Keep your link label as short as possible</li>
                <li>
                    Use relative links wherever possible -
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It is a lot easier to scan your code — relative URLs are generally a lot shorter than
                            absolute
                            URLs,
                            which makes reading code much easier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is more efficient to use relative URLs wherever possible. When you use an absolute URL,
                            the
                            browser starts by looking up the real location of the server on the DNS, then it goes to
                            that
                            server
                            and finds the file that is being
                            requested. With a relative URL on the other hand, the browser just looks up the file that is
                            being
                            requested, on the same server. So if you use absolute URLs where relative URLs would do, you
                            are
                            constantly making your browser do extra work, meaning that it will perform less efficiently.

                    Leave clear signpost when linking to non-HTML resources. When linking to a resource that will be
                    downloaded
                    (like a PDF or Word document) or streamed (like video or audio) or has another potentially
                    unexpected
                    effect
                    (opens a popup window, or loads a Flash movie), you should add clear wording to reduce any
                    confusion.

            <h3>What can be nested within a [p]?</h3>
            <span>Before the paragraph</span>
            <p>
                Inside a [p], I can <b>bold, <i>italicize and <u>underline</u></i></b> texts.
                Can we add an image? <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" id="firefox"> still inside [p].
                What if I add something with block display? Like a list:
            <ul>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Block! Man!</h1>
            </p>
            <span>After the paragraph</span>
            <p>
                See that there seems to be 2 paragraphs, one before the list, and one after the
                heading. This is because when html encountered another block-level element, e.g.
                the [ul], it added a closing [p] before the [ul], and added another opening [p]
                after the [h1].
            </p>
            <span>
                But is this the case for all block-level elements? Let's try with [ul]s and [li]s:
            </span>
            <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>
                    Second item
                    <ol>
                        <li>First item inside second item</li>
                        <li>Second item inside second item</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Third item</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As you can see, [li], despite being a block element, could contain [ol] inside.
