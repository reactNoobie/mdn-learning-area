    <h1>HTML best practices and experiments</h1>
    <h2>[head] element</h2>
    <p>
        you can (and really should) set the language of your page. This can be done by adding the lang attribute to the
        opening HTML tag, like [html lang="eng-US"]. You can also set subsections of your document to be recognised as
        different languages. For example, we could set our Japanese language section to be recognised as Japanese, with
        <b>[span lang="ja"]ご飯が熱い。[/span]</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Japanese: <span lang="ja">ご飯が熱い。</span>It could be rendered because of [meta charset="utf-8"].
        Try with [meta charset='iso-8859-1'] to see it break.
    </p>
    <div>
        Many [meta] elements include name and content attributes. Like
        <ul>
            <li><b>[meta name="author" content="Shadman Soumik"]</b></li>
            <li><b>[meta name="description" content="Description of the page"]</b></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        To add a favicon, save the icon in the same directory as the site's index page, saved in .ico format (most
        browsers will support favicons in more common formats like .gif or .png, but using the ICO format will ensure it
        works as far back as Internet Explorer 6.) This line in [head] adds the favicon:
        <code><b>[link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"]</b></code>
    </p>
    <h2>Texts in HTML</h2>
    <p>
        In HTML we use the [em] (emphasis) element to mark up certain things to stress something. As well as making the
        document more interesting to read, these are recognised by screen readers and spoken out in a different tone of
        voice.
        <em>Browsers style this as italic by default (this is inside [em])</em>, but you shouldn't use this tag purely
        to get italic styling. To do
        that, you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <i>perhaps an [i] element</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, the [strong] (strong importance) element is used to emphasize on something. As well as making the
        document
        more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers and spoken in a different tone of voice.
        <strong>Browsers style this as bold text by default (this is inside [strong])</strong>, but you shouldn't use
        this tag purely
        to get bold styling. To do that,
        you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <b>perhaps a [b] element</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Advanced text formatting</h3>
    
    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
    <p>
        Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. Well, they've been a feature of the
        Web since the very beginning, but they are what makes the Web a <em>Web</em> — they allow us to link our
        documents to any
        other document (or other resource) we want to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, and we can make
        apps available at a simple web address. Just about any web content can be converted to a link, so that when
        clicked (or otherwise activated) it will make the web browser go to another web address.
    </p>
    <p>
        See, this link opens in a ne&AElig;w (!) tab (using <b>target="_blank"</b> ).
        Also, on hover, a description is shown (using <b>title="description"</b>):
        <a href="https://reactnoobie.github.io/hello-world" title="FIFA-20 World Cup" target="_blank">
            Round-robin-2-legged fixture (and standings) generator
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document (known as a document fragment), rather than just
        to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want to link
        to. After adding <b>id="image"</b> to our image and <em>href-ing</em> to <b>#image</b>, we have
        <a href="#image">a link that takes us to the image</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can send mail through links using <b>[a href="mailto:"]</b>.
        <a href="mailto:reactnoobie@gmail.com">Mail to me</a>,
        <a href="mailto:">Mail to nobody</a>
        <a
            href="mailto:reactnoobie@gmail.com?cc=cc@gmail.com&bcc=bcc@gmail.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
            Mail with cc, bcc, subject, body
        </a>
    </p>
    <span>Some sample <b>mailto:</b> URLs:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>mailto:</li>
        <li>mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org,nobody@mozilla.org</li>
        <li>mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org</li>
        <li>mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org&subject=This%20is%20the%20subject</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Link best practices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use clear wordings. Good: <a href="https://firefox.com/">Download Firefox</a>,
            Bad: Click <a href="https://firefox.com/">here</a> to download Firefox.
        </li>
        <li>Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text</li>
        <li>Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise.</li>
        <li>Keep your link label as short as possible</li>
        <li>
            Use relative links wherever possible -
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is a lot easier to scan your code — relative URLs are generally a lot shorter than absolute URLs,
                    which makes reading code much easier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is more efficient to use relative URLs wherever possible. When you use an absolute URL, the
                    browser starts by looking up the real location of the server on the DNS, then it goes to that server
                    and finds the file that is being
                    requested. With a relative URL on the other hand, the browser just looks up the file that is being
                    requested, on the same server. So if you use absolute URLs where relative URLs would do, you are
                    constantly making your browser do extra work, meaning that it will perform less efficiently.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave clear signpost when linking to non-HTML resources. When linking to a resource that will be downloaded
            (like a PDF or Word document) or streamed (like video or audio) or has another potentially unexpected effect
            (opens a popup window, or loads a Flash movie), you should add clear wording to reduce any confusion.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
                        Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
                        Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.example.com/car-game">
                        Play the car game (requires Flash)
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the download attribute to provide a default save filename when linking to a download:
            <b>[a href="thelink" download="thething.theextension"]the link text[/a]</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Experiments</h2>
    <h3>What can be nested within a [p]?</h3>
    <span>Before the paragraph</span>
    <p>
        Inside a [p], I can <b>bold, <i>italicize and <u>underline</u></i></b> texts.
        Can we add an image? <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" id="image"> still inside [p].
        What if I add something with block display? Like a list:
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Block! Man!</h1>
    </p>
    <span>After the paragraph</span>
    <p>
        See that there seems to be 2 paragraphs, one before the list, and one after the
        heading. This is because when html encountered another block-level element, e.g.
        the [ul], it added a closing [p] before the [ul], and added another opening [p]
        after the [h1].
    </p>
    <span>
        But is this the case for all block-level elements? Let's try with [ul]s and [li]s:
    </span>
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>
            Second item
            <ol>
                <li>First item inside second item</li>
                <li>Second item inside second item</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        As you can see, [li], despite being a block element, could contain [ol] inside.
        &quot;It is perfectly ok to nest one list inside another one.&quot; - MDN.
