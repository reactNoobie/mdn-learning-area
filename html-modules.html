            <p>
                you can (and really should) set the language of your page. This can be done by adding the lang attribute
                to
                the
                opening HTML tag, like [html lang="eng-US"]. You can also set subsections of your document to be
                recognised
                as
                different languages. For example, we could set our Japanese language section to be recognised as
                Japanese,
                with
                <b>[span lang="ja"]ご飯が熱い。[/span]</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Japanese: <span lang="ja">ご飯が熱い。</span>It could be rendered because of [meta charset="utf-8"].
                Try with [meta charset='iso-8859-1'] to see it break.
            </p>
            <div>
                Many [meta] elements include name and content attributes. Like
                <ul>
                    <li><b>[meta name="author" content="Shadman Soumik"]</b></li>
                    <li><b>[meta name="description" content="Description of the page"]</b></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                To add a favicon, save the icon in the same directory as the site's index page, saved in .ico format
                (most
                browsers will support favicons in more common formats like .gif or .png, but using the ICO format will
                ensure it
                works as far back as Internet Explorer 6.) This line in [head] adds the favicon:
                <b>[link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"]</b>
            </p>
            <h2 id="document-structure">Document and Website Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar
                standard
                components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art
                project,
                or is
                just badly structured. HTML boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website
                (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column").
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Header ([header]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually
                    stays
                    the
                    same from one webpage to another.
                </dd>
                <dt>Navigation bar ([nav]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the
                    header,
                    this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation
                    on
                    your
                    website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar
                    to
                    be
                    part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some
                    also
                    argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two
                    features
                    better if they are separate.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Main content ([main] with various content subsections represented by [article], [section], and [div]
                    elements.):
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example,
                    the
                    video
                    you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news
                    headlines,
                    etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
                </dd>
                <dt>Sidebar ([aside], often placed inside [main]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in
                    the
                    main
                    content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to
                    related
                    articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary
                    navigation
                    system.
                </dd>
                <dt>Footer ([footer]):</dt>
                <dd>
                    A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or
                    contact
                    info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not
                    critical
                    or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing
                    links
                    for quick access to popular content.
                </dd>

                A typical website structure can be something like:
                <img src="images/sample-website.png" alt="Typical website structure" id="website-structure">
            </p>
            <span>
                Important things to know about website structure:
            </span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    [main] is for content <em>unique to this page</em>. Use [main] only once per page, and put it
                    directly inside [body]. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [article] encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the
                    page (e.g., a single blog post).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [section] is similar to [article], but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page
                    that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines
                    and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that
                    you can break [article]s up into different [section]s, or [section]s up into different [article]s,
                    depending on the context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [aside] contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional
                    information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [header] represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of [body] it defines the
                    global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an [article] or [section] it defines a specific
                    header for that section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [nav] contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go
                    in the navigation.
                </li>
                <li>[footer] represents a group of end content for a page.</li>
                <li>
                    Non-semantic wrappers:
                    Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal semantic element to group
                    some items together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want to just group a set of
                    elements together to affect them all as a single entity with some CSS or JavaScript. For cases
                    like these, HTML provides the [div] and [span] elements. You should use these preferably with a
                    suitable class attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            [div] is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of
                            a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            [span] is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a
                            better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific
                            meaning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warning">
                Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they
                just clutter your HTML code. Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and
                try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your
                documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two elements that you'll use occasionally are [br] and [hr]:<br>
                [br] creates a line break in a paragraph; it is the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation
                where you want a series of fixed short lines, such as in a postal address or a poem.<br>
                [hr] elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text (such
                as a change in topic or scene). Visually it just looks like a horizontal line.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Once you've planned out the structure of a simple webpage, the next logical step is to try to work out
                what content you want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged
                and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called Information architecture.
                In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a simple website of a
                few pages, this can be fairly simple, and fun!
            </p>
            <h2 id="texts-in-html">Texts in HTML</h2>
            <p>
                In HTML we use the [em] (emphasis) element to mark up certain things to stress something. As well as
                making
                the
                document more interesting to read, these are recognised by screen readers and spoken out in a different
                tone
                of
                voice.
                <em>Browsers style this as italic by default (this is inside [em])</em>, but you shouldn't use this tag
                purely
                to get italic styling. To do
                that, you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <i>perhaps an [i] element</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the [strong] (strong importance) element is used to emphasize on something. As well as making
                the
                document
                more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers and spoken in a different tone of voice.
                <strong>Browsers style this as bold text by default (this is inside [strong])</strong>, but you
                shouldn't
                use
                this tag purely
                to get bold styling. To do that,
                you'd use a [span] element and some CSS, or <b>perhaps a [b] element</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced text formatting</h3>
            <span>Description lists are created using [dl], [dt] (description term) and [dd] (description
                definition)</span>
            <dl>
                <dt>Messi</dt>
                <dd>The greatest footballer the world will ever see.</dd>
                <dt>Ronaldo</dt>
                <dd>Very good but not as good as Messi</dd>

                <dd>First description</dd>
                <dd>Second description</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted
                from
                somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a
                &lt;blockquote&gt; element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside
                a
                cite
                attribute. Browser default styling will render this as an indented paragraph, as an indicator that it is
                a
                quote.
            </p>
            <span>A blockquote, cited by MDN:</span>
            <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
                <p>
                    The HTML <b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element)
                    indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. It was written as
                    <code>[blockquote cite="url"]A paragraph[/blockquote]</code>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the [q] element. This great quote
                <q cite="https://reactnoobie.github.io/hello-world">It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you
                    do
                    not stop.</q> was written inside an inline quote.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content of the cite attribute sounds useful, but unfortunately browsers, screenreaders, etc. don't
                really do
                much with it. There is no way to get the browser to display the contents of cite, without writing your
                own
                solution using JavaScript or CSS. There is a [cite] element, but this is meant to contain the title of
                the
                resource being quoted, e.g. the name of the book. We can link the text inside [cite] to the quote source
                by
                combining [blockquote] / [q], [cite] and [a]. Citations are styled in italic font by default.

                You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical
                formulae,
                and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The [sup] and [sub] elements handle this.

                There are many elements available for marking up computer code using HTML: [code], [pre], [var], [kbd],
                [samp].
            </p>
            <p>
                [code]: For marking up generic pieces of computer code (inline element). Let's write a multiline sort:
                <code>
                const sort = (a, b) => {
                    console.log(a, b);
                    return a.val - b.val;
                }
            </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                [pre]: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) — if you use indentation or excess whitespace
                inside
                your text,
                browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page. If you wrap the text in
                [pre] tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it in your text editor.
                Let's
                write our multiline sort code inside [pre] tags:
            </p>
            <pre>const sort = (a, b) => {
    console.log(a, b);
    return a.val - b.val;
}</pre>
            <p>
                [var] tag marks up variable names. In the above examples,
                <var>sort</var> in <code>const <var>sort</var> = ...</code> could be marked up with [var].
            </p>
            <p>
                Use [kbd] tag for marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer. E.g. Press
                <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to reformat code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use [samp] tag for marking up the output of a computer program. Samp is inline:
                <samp>
                    On branch html-modules
                    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/html-modules'.

                    Changes not staged for commit:
                    (use "git add [file]..." to update what will be committed)
                    (use "git restore [file]..." to discard changes in working directory)

            <p>
                HTML also provides the [time] element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format. For
                example:
                <code>[time datetime="2016-01-20"]20 January 2016[/time]</code>.
                Why is this useful? Well, there are many different ways that humans write down dates. The above date
                could
                be written as 20th January 2016, Jan 20 2016, 20/01/16, 01/20/16, The 20th of next month, 20e Janvier
                2016,
                2016年1月20日 and so on...
            </p>
            <p>
                But these different forms cannot be easily recognised by computers — what if you wanted to automatically
                grab
                the dates of all events in a page and insert them into a calendar? The [time] element allows you to
                attach
                an
                unambiguous, machine-readable time/date for this purpose. The basic example above just provides a simple
                machine
                readable date, but there are many other options that are possible, for example -
            </p>

                <dt>Standard simple date</dt>
                <dd>[time datetime="2016-01-20"]20 January 2016[/time]</dd>

            <h2 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h2>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. Well, they've been a feature
                of
                the
                Web since the very beginning, but they are what makes the Web a <em>Web</em> — they allow us to link our
                documents to any
                other document (or other resource) we want to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, and we
                can
                make
                apps available at a simple web address. Just about any web content can be converted to a link, so that
                when
                clicked (or otherwise activated) it will make the web browser go to another web address.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, this link opens in a ne&AElig;w (!) tab (using <b>target="_blank"</b> ).
                Also, on hover, a description is shown (using <b>title="description"</b>):
                <a href="https://reactnoobie.github.io/hello-world" title="FIFA-20 World Cup" target="_blank">
                    Round-robin-2-legged fixture (and standings) generator
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document (known as a document fragment), rather
                than
                just
                to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want
                to
                link
                to. After adding <b>id="image"</b> to our image and <em>href-ing</em> to <b>#image</b>, we have
                <a href="#image">a link that takes us to the image</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can send mail through links using <b>[a href="mailto:"]</b>.
                <a href="mailto:reactnoobie@gmail.com">Mail to me</a>,
                <a href="mailto:">Mail to nobody</a>

            <h3>Link best practices:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use clear wordings. Good: <a href="https://firefox.com/">Download Firefox</a>,
                    Bad: Click <a href="https://firefox.com/">here</a> to download Firefox.
                </li>
                <li>Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text</li>
                <li>Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise.</li>
                <li>Keep your link label as short as possible</li>
                <li>
                    Use relative links wherever possible -
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It is a lot easier to scan your code — relative URLs are generally a lot shorter than
                            absolute
                            URLs,
                            which makes reading code much easier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is more efficient to use relative URLs wherever possible. When you use an absolute URL,
                            the
                            browser starts by looking up the real location of the server on the DNS, then it goes to
                            that
                            server
                            and finds the file that is being
                            requested. With a relative URL on the other hand, the browser just looks up the file that is
                            being
                            requested, on the same server. So if you use absolute URLs where relative URLs would do, you
                            are
                            constantly making your browser do extra work, meaning that it will perform less efficiently.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave clear signpost when linking to non-HTML resources. When linking to a resource that will be
                    downloaded
                    (like a PDF or Word document) or streamed (like video or audio) or has another potentially
                    unexpected
                    effect
                    (opens a popup window, or loads a Flash movie), you should add clear wording to reduce any
                    confusion.

                The <strong>alt</strong> attribute's value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use
                in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow
                internet connection. The <strong>title</strong> attribute works similar to link titles. It is shown when

                You shouldn't alter the size of your images using HTML attributes. If you set the image size too big,

                image that is not fitting the user's needs. The image may also end up looking distorted, if you don't
                maintain the correct aspect ratio. You should use an image editor to put your image at the correct size
                before putting it on your webpage. If you do need to alter an image's size, you should use CSS instead.

                [figure] and [figcaption] elements are created to provide a semantic container for figures, and to

                technology that the caption describes the other content of the [figure] element. A figure doesn't have
                to be an image. It could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or
                something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use CSS to embed images into webpages (and JavaScript, but that's another story entirely).
                The CSS background-image property, and the other background-* properties, are used to control background
                image placement. For example, to place a background image on every paragraph on a page, you could do
                this:
            </p>
            <pre class="with-background">p {
    background-image: url("../images/firefox2.jpg");
}</pre>
            <p>
                The resulting embedded image, is arguably easier to position and control than HTML images. So why bother
                with HTML images? CSS background images are for decoration only. If you just want to add something
                pretty to your page to enhance the visuals, this is fine. Though, such images have no
                semantic meaning at all. They can't have any text equivalents, are invisible to screen readers, and so
                on. This is where HTML images shine! Summing up: if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you
                should use an HTML image. If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images.
            </p>
            <h2 id="embedding-audio-and-video">Embedding Audio and Video</h2>
            <p>
                Web developers have wanted to use video and audio on the Web for a long time, ever since the early 2000s
                when we started to have bandwidth fast enough to support any kind of video (video files are much larger
                than text or even images.) In the early days, native web technologies such as HTML didn't have the
                ability to embed video and audio on the Web, so proprietary (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash
                (and later, Silverlight) became popular for handling such content. This kind of technology worked ok,
                but it had a number of problems, including not working well with HTML/CSS features, security issues, and
                accessibility issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                A native solution would solve much of this if implemented correctly. Fortunately, a few years later the
                HTML5 specification had such features added, with the [video] and [audio] elements, and some shiny new
                JavaScript APIs for controlling them.
            </p>
            <video src="media/rabbit320.mp4" controls poster="images/sasuke.jpg">
                <p>
                    If you don't see this, then too bad...
                </p>
            </video>
            <span>This was written with:</span>
            <pre>[video src="media/rabbit320.mp4" controls poster="images/sasuke.jpg"]
    [p]

    [/p]
[/video]</pre>
            <p>
                You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your
                interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start
                and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.<br><br>
                The paragraph inside is called fallback content — this will be displayed if the browser accessing the
                page doesn't support the [video] element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can
                be anything you like, e.g. a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way
                regardless of what browser they are using.
            </p>
            <p>
                To optimize compatibility, it's worth considering providing more than one version of media files, using
                the [source] element to specify each source within the [audio] or [video] element. To do this, you
                create a [video] (or [audio]) element with no src attribute. Then add child [source] elements within the
                [video] element, one for each version of the video you offer. This can be used to offer various versions
                of a video that can be selected depending on bandwidth availability, but in our case, we'll use it to
                offer format options. In the example shown here, a video is offered to the browser in two formats: WebM
                and MP4.

                    You can control the video size either with these attributes or with CSS. In both cases, videos
                    maintain their native width-height ratio — known as the aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio is not
                    maintained by the sizes you set, the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, and the
                    unfilled space will just be given a solid background color by default.

                WebVTT is a format for writing text files containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such
                as the time in the video at which each text string should be displayed, and even limited
                styling/positioning information. These text strings are called cues, and there are several kinds of cues
                which are used for different purposes. The most common cues are:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>subtitles</dt>
                <dd>
                    Translations of foreign material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.

                <dt>captions</dt>
                <dd>
                    Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, to let people who can't
                    hear the audio / understand what is going on.
                </dd>
                <dt>timed descriptions</dt>
                <dd>
                    Text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe important visuals to blind or
                    otherwise visually impaired users.

            </dl>
            <p>
                To get this displayed along with the HTML media playback, you need to save it as a .vtt file in a
                sensible place, then link to the .vtt file with the [track] element. [track] should be placed within
                [audio] or [video], but after all [source] elements. Use the kind attribute to specify whether the cues
                are subtitles, captions, or descriptions. Further, use srclang to tell the browser what language you
                have written the subtitles in.
            </p>
            <span>Each track element has the following attribute set:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>kind</em> is given a value of subtitles, indicating the type of content the files contain
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>label</em> is given a value indicating which language that subtitle set is for — for example
                    English or
                    Deutsch — these labels will appear in the user interface to allow the user to easily select which
                    subtitle language they want to see.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>src</em> is assigned a valid URL pointing to the relevant WebVTT subtitle file in each case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>srclang</em> indicates what language each subtitle files' contents are in (can specify the

                At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at some elements that allow you to
                embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the [iframe], [embed] and [object] elements.
                [iframe]s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed PDFs, SVG, and
                even Flash — a technology that is on the way out, but which you'll still see semi-regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                [iframe] provides a way to embed an entire web document inside another one, as if it were an [img] or
                other such element, and is used regularly today. Go to YouTube/Google Maps -> share -> embed -> copy ->
                paste gives:

            <span>The basic essentials needed to create an iframe are:</span>
            <dl>
                <dt>allowfullscreen</dt>
                <dd>
                    If set, the [iframe] is able to be placed in fullscreen mode using the Full Screen API.
                </dd>
                <dt>frameborder</dt>
                <dd>
                    If set to 1, this tells the browser to draw a border between this frame and other frames, which is
                    the default behaviour. 0 removes the border. Using this isn't really recommended any more, as the
                    same effect can be better achieved using border: none; in your CSS.
                </dd>
                <dt>sandbox</dt>
                <dd>
                    This attribute, which works in slightly more modern browsers than the rest of the [iframe] features
                    (e.g. IE 10 and above) requests heightened security settings.
                </dd>
                <dt>Fallback content, src, width, height</dt>
                <dd>Same as [video], [audio].</dd>
            </dl>
            <p class="important">
                In order to improve speed, it's a good idea to set the iframe's src attribute with JavaScript after the
                main content is done with loading. This makes your page usable sooner and decreases your official page
                load time (an important SEO metric).
            </p>
            <span>Security concerns with [iframe]:</span>
            <ul class="warning">
                <li>Only embed when necessary</li>
                <li>No matter what the cost, you must never embed third-party content with HTTP.</li>
                <li>
                    Always use the sandbox attribute. Never add both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin to your sandbox
                    attribute - in that case, the embedded content could use JavaScript to turn off sandboxing
                    altogether.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configure CSP directives. CSP stands for content security policy and provides a set of HTTP Headers
                    (metadata sent along with your web pages when they are served from a web server) designed to improve
                    the security of your HTML document. When it comes to securing [iframe]s, you can configure your
                    server to send an appropriate X-Frame-Options header. This can prevent other websites from
                    embedding your content in their web pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                [embed] and [object] are general purpose embedding tools for embedding multiple types of external
                content, which include plugin technologies like Java Applets and Flash, PDF (which can be shown in a
                browser with a PDF plugin), and even content like videos, SVG and images! However, you are unlikely to
                use these elements very much — Applets haven't been used for years, Flash is no longer very popular,
                PDFs tend to be better linked to than embedded, and other content such as images and video have much
                better, easier elements to handle those. Plugins and these embedding methods are really a legacy
                technology.

                Due to its inherent issues and the lack of support for Flash, Adobe announced that they would stop

                by December 31st of 2020, all browsers will have completly removed all Flash functionality. Any existing

            <p>
                Vector graphics are very useful in many circumstances - they have small file sizes and are highly
                scalable, so they don't pixelate when zoomed in or blown up to a large size.
            </p>
            <p>
                SVG is an XML-based language for describing vector images. It's basically markup, like HTML, except that
                you've got many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the
                effects you want to apply to those shapes. SVG is for marking up graphics, not content. At the simplest
                end of the spectrum, you've got elements for creating simple shapes, like [circle] and [rect]. More
                advanced SVG features include [feColorMatrix] (transform colors using a transformation matrix,)
                [animate] (animate parts of your vector graphic,) and [mask] (apply a mask over the top of your image.)

                You can assign classes and ids to SVG elements and style them with CSS, either within the SVG or
                wherever you put the CSS style rules for your HTML document. In fact, you can use any SVG presentation
                attribute as a CSS property. Inlining SVG is the only approach that lets you use CSS interactions (like
                :focus) and CSS animations on your SVG image (even in your regular stylesheet.).
                You can make SVG markup into a hyperlink by wrapping it in an [a] element.

            <h2 id="responsive-images">Responsive Images</h2>
            <p>
                Responsive image technologies were implemented recently. It lets you offer the browser several image
                files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution
                switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).
            </p>
            <h3>Resolution switching: Different sizes</h3>
            <p>
                We can use two new attributes — srcset and sizes — to provide several additional source images along
                with hints to help the browser pick the right one.
            </p>
            <img class="block" style="max-width: 100%;" srcset="images/messi-480px.jpg 480w,
                         images/messi-720px.jpg 720w,
                         images/messi-1080px.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 100vw,
                        (min-width: 700px) 50vw,
                        (min-width: 500px) 25vw" src="images/sasuke.jpg" alt="Sasuke">
            <pre>[img class="block" style="max-width: 100%;"
    srcset="images/messi-480px.jpg 480w,
            images/messi-720px.jpg 720w,
            images/messi-1080px.jpg 1080w"
    sizes="(min-width: 900px) 75vw,
           (min-width: 700px) 50vw,
           (min-width: 500px) 25vw"
    src="images/sasuke.jpg" alt="Sasuke"
]</pre>
            <p>
                srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image
                is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma.<br>
                sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best
                to choose, when certain media conditions are true.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these attributes in place, the browser will look at its device width, work out which media
                condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true, look at the slot size given to that media
                query, load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there
                isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.
            </p>
            <h3>Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions</h3>
            <p>
                If you're supporting multiple display resolutions, but everyone sees your image at the same real-world
                size on the screen, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset
                with x-descriptors and without sizes — a somewhat easier syntax! Define the image size in CSS.
            </p>
            <img class="block responsive-image" srcset="images/messi-480px.jpg,
                         images/messi-720px.jpg 1.5x,
                         images/messi-1080px.jpg 2x" src="images/sasuke.jpg"
                alt="Show Sasuke if the srcset and sizes are not supported">
            <pre>[img
    srcset="images/messi-480px.jpg,
            images/messi-720px.jpg 1.5x,
            images/messi-1080px.jpg 2x"
    src="images/sasuke.jpg"
    alt="Show Sasuke if the srcset and sizes are not supported"
]</pre>
            <h3>Art direction</h3>
            <p>
                The art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display
                sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed
                on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person
                in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image
                on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The [picture] element allows us to implement just this kind of
                solution. Make the browser wide/narrow (or zoom in/out) to see the image change.
            </p>
            <picture class="block">
                <source media="(min-width: 850px)" srcset="images/messi-1080px.jpg">
                <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="images/messi-720px.jpg">
                <img class="block responsive-image" src="images/messi-480px.jpg" alt="Messi the greatest of all time">
            </picture>
            <pre>[picture class="block"]
    [source media="(min-width: 850px)" srcset="images/messi-1080px.jpg"]
    [source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="images/messi-720px.jpg"]
    [img class="block responsive-image" src="images/messi-480px.jpg" alt="Messi"]
[/picture]</pre>
            <p class="important">
                When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main
                parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in
                general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to
                implement solutions like srcset. For example, you couldn't load the [img] element, then detect the
                viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if
                desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image
                as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The content of every table is enclosed within [table] tags.
                    <table></table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a [td] element ('td'
                    stands for 'table data').
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each [td] element creates a single cell and together they make up one row. Every cell we add
                    makes the row grow longer.
                    <table>
                        <td>Data 1</td>
                        <td>Data 2</td>
                        <td>Data 3</td>
                        <td>Data 4</td>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To stop this row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, we need to use the
                    [tr] element ('tr' stands for 'table row').
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Data 1</td>
                            <td>Data 2</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Data 3</td>
                            <td>Data 4</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the [th]
                    element ('th' stands for 'table header'). This works in exactly the same way as a [td], except that
                    it denotes a header, not a normal cell. Go into your HTML, and change all the [td] elements
                    surrounding the table headers into [th] elements.
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>X</td>
                            <th>0</th>
                            <th>1</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>0</th>
                            <td>?</td>
                            <td>?</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>1</th>
                            <td>?</td>
                            <td>?</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Table headers and cells have the colspan and rowspan attributes, which accept a unitless number
                    value, which equals the number of rows or columns you want spanned. For example, colspan="2" makes a
                    cell span two columns.
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>X</td>
                            <th colspan="2">0</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th rowspan="2">0</th>
                            <td>?</td>
                            <td>?</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>?</td>
                            <td>?</td>
                        </tr>

                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML has a method of defining styling information for an entire column of data all in one place —
                    the [col] and [colgroup] elements. [col] elements are specified inside a [colgroup] container just
                    below the opening [table] tag. If we wanted to apply the styling information to multiple columns, we
                    could just include one [col] element with a span attribute on it.
                    <table>
                        <colgroup>
                            <col class="dark-column">

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can give your table a caption by enclosing with [caption] tag and putting it just below the
                    opening [table] tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As your tables get a bit more complex in structure, it is useful to give them more structural
                    definition. One clear way to do this is by using [thead], [tfoot], and [tbody], which allow you to
                    mark up a header, footer, and body section for the table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These elements don't make the table any more accessible to screenreader users, and don't result in
                    any visual enhancement on their own. They are however very useful for styling and layout — acting as
                    useful hooks for adding CSS to your table. To give you some interesting examples, in the case of a
                    long table you could make the table header and footer repeat on every printed page, and you could
                    make the table body display on a single page and have the contents available by scrolling up and
                    down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The [thead] element must wrap the part of the table that is the header — this is usually the first
                    row containing the column headings, but this is not necessarily always the case. If you are using
                    [col]/[colgroup] element, the table header should come just below those.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The [tfoot] element needs to wrap the part of the table that is the footer — this might be a final
                    row with items in the previous rows summed, for example. You can include the table footer right at
                    the bottom of the table as you'd expect, or just below the table header (the browser will still
                    render it at the bottom of the table).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The [tbody] element needs to wrap the other parts of the table content that aren't in the table
                    header or footer. It will appear below the table header or sometimes footer, depending on how you
                    decided to structure it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is possible to nest a table inside another one, as long as you include the complete structure,
                    including the [table] element. This is generally not really advised, however sometimes necessary,
                    for example if you want to import content easily from other sources.
                    <table>

                    The scope attribute can be added <strong>to the [th] element</strong> to tell screenreaders exactly
                    what cells the header is a header for — is it a header for the row it is in, or the column? It can
                    take one of 4 values: row, col, rowgroup, colgroup. rowgroup and colgroup are used for
                    headings that sit over the top of multiple columns or rows.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An alternative to using the scope attribute is to use id and headers attributes to create
                    associations between headers and cells. Add a unique id to each [th] element and add a headers
                    attribute to each [td] element. Each headers attribute has to contain a list of the ids of all the
                    [th] elements that act as a header for that cell, separated by spaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, using id and headers method creates very precise associations between headers and data
                    cells but it uses a lot more markup and does not leave any room for errors. The scope approach is
                    usually enough for most tables.
